TO DO :


General :
- Clean free_exit function : Destroy mutex, close thread, protect malloc and possible fail
- Monitor death between each step to avoid gap between death and stop of program

Time :
- Define "start_time" variable
- Lock threads before every threads are created to make them start all together
- Display timestamp differently

Meals_count :
- Everything (Mutex / meals_count++ / ...)

and more i guess
